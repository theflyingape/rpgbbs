                                The future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The next release of LhA will be V2.00. It will contain numerous
enhancements and new features. The release date is not set as of now, but
expect to see it late September or early October.

  Some of the new features are ...

 o New compression modes. Significantly faster and more efficient. 10-200%
   faster decompression. Intelligent modes detect data type and adjusts
   compression parameters for optimal performance. See BenchM.txt for
   preliminary performance figures.

 o Raw disk I/O capability. Now you can archive raw disk images a la DMS,
   or write archives directly to disks without using any filing system.
   This coupled with the multivolume archive and catalog capability makes
   LhA a powerful CLI-controlled backup program.

 o Completely rewritten I/O routines. Now disk I/O is much more efficient
   and faster. I/O buffers of any size allowed to cater for even the most
   extreme user's needs. Supports archiving to tape streamers and reading/
   writing from/to pipes. Asynchronous I/O to any device supported.

 o New "virtual files", temporary files are primarily created in RAM, and
   if the file does not fit entirely in RAM, it will be continued on
   another device. Convenient when archiving or updating extremely large
   files/archives.

 o Localization. The programs can be made to output strings in various
   languages through use of the new WB2.1 locale.library

 o Support for new file systems. Supports all CBM supplied filesystems.

 o Entirely new multivolume archive handling. More flexible and easier to
   use. Supports writing to several different devices in succession
   (cyclic). For example DF0->DF1->DF3->DF0->DF1 and so on ...

 o Link support. Both hard and soft.

 o Logging. All actions can be logged. Adjustable verbosity level.

 o More powerful and flexible command line parsing. Different environment
   variables for different commands possible.

 o GUI preferences editor to configure all options more easily.
   [KickStart 2.04 and later only].

 o Encryption and autoverification.

 o New commands and options to make handling of multivolume archives etc.
   easier.

 o Network support.

 o Significantly faster and more flexible in general.

 o LZ, LhArc and old-LhA front-ends to make switching from obsolete
   archivers easier (translates command-lines to LhA 2.00 format).

 o New and improved documentation.

  Furthermore, some time after the release of LhA V2.00, LhI will be
available. LhI is a window-driven archiver for KickStart 2.04 and up ONLY.
More details later.

  SUPPORT:

  By the time of LhA V2.00's release there will be several LhA support
centers around the world which will accept registrations, distribute and
provide technical support. Current plans are for Germany, USA, Canada,
Australia and possibly a few more. More about this when V2.00 is finally
released.

  In the meantime... Have fun!

            Stefan
