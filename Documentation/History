                    * Tavern brawls have two new saving throws for ducking or
                      landing a punch with a +/-5% ratio.

v3.00  18-Sep-1992  * Display initialization procedure to console.
                    * <2400 baud users don't get the Logon file.  Really.

                    * Eliminated Tables.c and made Config program for more
                      customization.

v3.01  21-Sep-1992  * Escaping the dungeon when sent there by the old sea hag
                      is not good enough.  You must now defeat the bitch in
                      combat.  She's a level 99 God with 1/6th the hit points
                      and she cannot teleport away.
                    * Neptune of the Sea cannot teleport away.

                      remote user logs on.
                    * Added Sysop functions View loser log & eXterminate user.
                      The sysop.log is useful for tracking down "chronies" who
                      use them to augment their real characters.  There are a
                      lot of cheaters who can't play by the rules, thus the
                      exterminate function -- make 'em play again!

                      number can get verified.  "Bad" phone numbers get logged
                      in BadPhone.list to mark unwanted dialbacks.
                    * Money format default replaces scientific format.  Now

                    * Riddle of Key sequence remains same for rolling user
                      until it is solved to advance to Hero.  It gets reset if
                      System Reroll or Hero does not advance to Titan.
                    * Mollicone spell becomes Mayhem spell.  New spell Morph

                    * Fishing for oysters now have a cannon factor involved,
                      so the less cannons you have, the less gold you receive
                      for pearl/diamond.
                    * Defense agility was not taken in account properly!
                    * Key Hint works properly now.
                    * Brawl algorithm calculates for character class now.
                      This is to account for Beast & Undead class that get no
                      + agility bonus.  Magic users (again) get screwed, but
                      it goes with the flow.  Defense agility calculated in.
                    * Robbing the bank properly alerts users-with-Bank-money

                sound support for chat mode and other various events.  New
                sercon.library supports ZOOM gadget (suppress local console
                output) for faster modem throughput.

01-Apr-1995   * All executables recompiled and optimized for SAS/C v6.55.  A
                player can no longer duck a punch and hit a dead or jailed
                player.

01-Jul-1995   * Ego Weapons & Armor.  Auto-purge added to delete players that
                haven't called in some time.  New players must start as Novice
                class fighters.  Morph & Disintegrate spells have swapped
                places on spell list (#15 & #16).

01-Aug-1995   * xemrpgbbs.library created for use with Term and other Amiga
                terminal programs that support external emulation.  Emulation
                now supports any point size, not just my wife's size (8).  New
                rpgbbs.library completely replaces sercon.library.  Naval
                warships cannot carry more than a full complement of cannons
                cost -- the rest of the booty will sink to the ocean floor.

01-Sep-1995   * Fixed many Enforcer-hits!  Added Iconify menu item for Modem
                Lines; iconified clients yield faster serial ops.  Fixed bug
                from SAS/C getft(); use AmigaDOS DateToStr().

01-Oct-1995   * Money lost to another player gets applied towards his
                outstanding loan first, the remaining balance is left in his
                hands.  Upon first caller after midnight, server moves any
                money in player's hands to his bank account.

01-Nov-1995   * All executables recompiled and optimized for SAS/C v6.56.
                Added extended spells to dungeon: Armor Rusting, Weapon Decay,
                Big Blast, Mana Stealing, Life Stealing.  Player may find Wand
                or Scroll; Spell may be taught from a Wish.

01-Dec-1995   * Added Mystical Wheel of Life to Dungeon.  Only Novice Players
                will get the dungeon prompt all the time.  Fixed extended spell
                bugs.  A player's bounty postings get erased when that player
                rolls.

                BLACK, \1 for RED, \2 for GREEN, \3 for YELLOW, \4 for BLUE, \5
                for MAGENTA, \6 for CYAN, and \7 for WHITE.  Plus, \10 + color
                #0-7 to add BOLD and/or \100 to add blink.

17-Feb-1996   * Added Top 20 feature to High Score List.

08-Mar-1996   * You can no longer `bump' into someone going to the Square when
                `visiting'.  Life Stealing spell will take up to half the
                victim's experience points away from him, but the taker may
                only get up to their level's worth of experience (and possibly
                go up an experience level during the battle).

16-Mar-1996   * Hack & Slash BBS hits 60,000 calls made from 19-Jun-1992.
                (~44 calls/day).  Adjustments made to class, magic, naval,
                and weapon file sets.  Battling another user's warship may
                result in permament hull-point loss, regardless of mounted
                cannons.  Any gang member that teleports away during the
                party is the same as not participating in the first place.
                This can affect the spoils collected at the end of the fight.

01-May-1996   * Added some more local, sound effects.  Sea Hag is now cursed
                and armed with random ego items.

25-Sep-1996   * Added dungeon MODs while exploring the deep, dank dungeon.
                This release is now FREEWARE and my final release (for now).
                Moohahahaha-ha!
