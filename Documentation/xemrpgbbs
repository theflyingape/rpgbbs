xemrpgbbs.library
=================
This file should reside in your LIBS:  directory as shown above.  The
filename is case sensitive, so keep the name in lowercase.

Using it with Term is a snap, just select menu option Settings - Terminal
and change the Emulation mode to External.  Select xemrpgbbs.library!

What this does is gives you both DEC-VT220 and IBM-PC ANSI emulation at the
same time _with_ a special protocol for handling bit-mapped graphics over
the telephone lines.  RPGBBS, aka Hack & Slash, sends such files.

In the future, their will be special support for 256-color graphics and
sound.

Known Glitch?
=============
You can change the font name/size using Settings - Emulation.  Although it
saves any changes to ENV: & ENVARC:, point size changes will not take
effect immediately.  The xem closes the font and re-opens the new size, but
for whatever reason, it is not apparent on the screen.  Either type "avail
flush" at a CLI-prompt to remove unused fonts/libraries or reboot the
machine.  Go figure.
