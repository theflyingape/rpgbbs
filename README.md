Amiga Hack &amp; Slash (BBS)

The portly man with the bulging coin purse approaches with his two
strong, but inexperienced-looking bodyguards.  Without so much as extending
his hand, he speaks.

"So ye think ye want to be an adventurer, eh?" After scanning you
over, he continues.  "Certainly don't look the type, all sissified and
soft.  Ye'll be running for yer wetnurse soon enough, I'll warrant.  But if
ye want to play with the big boys, ye've come to the right place.  Ye want
to be rich, famous, an' powerful like the rest, don't ye?  Aye, else ye
wouldn't be here.

Well, don't be thinkin' this is a cakewalk.  Ye'll be payin' yer
dues, and there's plenty of 'em to be paid.  By the way, me name's Joe
Mollicone.  Ye can call me 'Sir', or 'Mr.  Mollicone', or simply 'Taxman',
that's what I does here, but don't let me catch ye badmouthin' me behind me
back."

As he turns to leave, he shouts behind him.  "Personally, I don't
think ye has what it takes.  Best to run yer yellow butt back to where it
came from."

RPGBBS Deluxe is basically a bulletin board built around a medieval
role-playing atmosphere (or is it the other way around?).  Though it has
the standard BBS functions, such as a message base, file section, and
e-mail, there are no online games.  Instead, you LIVE the online game as
you kill, rob from, brawl, and joust the other members to gain levels and
fortune.  The success of this game is dependent upon the users that play
it.  Your involvment will not only provide you with entertainment, but also
shares your activity with the other players.
