Being a novice is not necessarily a bad thing.  A Novice class adventurer
is quite capable of defeating any of the toughest creatures and experienced
players found here.  You might even find, at first, that slaying monsters
and players is a bit easy.  Don't fret!  Although a novice is not equipped
for casting magical spells, they are subject to their effects (except for
the nasty Morph spell!)

Upon reaching immortality (level 100), you will be given a new title, which
will grant you all the rights & privileges worthy of a deserving adventurer.

Enjoy your stay here.  And please call often enough to keep your character,
and the rest of the competition, alive and healthy.  If for whatever reason
you cannot play for a stretch of time, this system may automatically delete 
your character.  Do not be alarmed if this should ever happen.  Just sign on
again as a new user, and you will be treated as such.
