You can only ascend to a Titan class from immortalizing a Paladin class and
again solving the Ancient Riddle of the Keys.  A Titan is the second class
of the superbeings.  Titans have Barbarian combat abilities coupled with a
Magician's use of spells.  They get greater backstabs and use of poisons
than the Hero.  Titans receive two extra bonuses in all abilities per
experience level.
