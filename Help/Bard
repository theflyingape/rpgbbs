The Bard-class enjoys every aspect of the game:  backstabbing, magic,
stealing, and fighting.  However, the Bard does not specialize in any of
his abilities, thus his experiences can be either rewarding or frustrating.
An entertainer by trade, Bards receive an extra bonus in Charisma per
experience level.
