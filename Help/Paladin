A Paladin class can only be achieved by becoming immortal (100th level) and
solving the Ancient Riddle of the Keys.  A Paladin is the lowest class of
the superbeings.  Paladins have good combat abilities coupled with the use
of magic scrolls.  Paladins receive an extra bonus in all abilities per
experience level.
