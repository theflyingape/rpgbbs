The highest superbeing of them all, you can only ascend to a God from a
Titan class.  Gods have what is best in all of the classes:  a Barbarian's
strength, spell-casting power of a Sage, a Thief's backstab, an Alchemist's
use of poisons.  A God receives an extra bonus in all abilities per
experience level.
