The Alchemist depends greatly on his ability to use poisons.  His skills
enable him to apply 4x the poison value yielding the greatest effect on his
weapon.  Without that aid, the Alchemist leaves much to be desired as far
as natural fighting skills are concerned.  Being a creature of science,
this is the one class that cannot use any magical device.  The Alchemist
may, however, resist the effects of a spell or magical device.  Alchemists
receive an extra bonus in Intellect per experience level.
