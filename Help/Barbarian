The strongest, combat-class fighter in the game, but the most susceptible
to the effects of magic.  As the Barbarian grows in experience, his hitting
power augments.  There will be a point where a Barbarian's essence can
match the power of any man- made weapon.  Barbarians recieve an extra bonus
in Stamina per experience level.
