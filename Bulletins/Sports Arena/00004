With the Jets making a lot of noise in the off-season, will they make
it to the playoffs this year?  I believe Denver to be washed-up, but
it may be just wishful thinking.  Will the Raiders do something?!
Patriot chances look good, but again we are operating with dicey
Running and Trick-or-Treat Special Teams.

I'll stick with AFC Pats versus NFC Vikings in the Super Bowl for
1999.
