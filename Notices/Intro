This Amiga computer system is dedicated to run this fine Role-Playing Game.
Although this BBS provides traditional services, public messages and file
transfers, its main purpose is to provide a fantasy, medieval setting for
the players (YOU) to interact with one another in fights, jousts, brawls,
and other explorations.  While the action here can get hot, this BBS
provides an excellent source of playful recreation.

The object of this game is to ascend in experience levels until reaching
level 100.  There, you become immortal and have a chance to become a
powerful Paladin, Titan, or God-character.  The first player to roll as a
God-class wins the game and the board is reset.  As recognition for winning
the game, the player will be awarded a Certificate and a pair of tickets to
the Showcase Cinemas (out-of-state players will get a box of chocolates).

You start by creating a character class, i.e., a Fighter, and assign
ability points to define its capabilities.  A good place to begin is in the
Arena to start a joust with another user.  If successful, you can win money
from the contest to buy a weapon or some armor from the Town Square.  The
rest is up to you to explore on your own.

Happy Hunting!
